### README
            This program has the ability to create clusters of multidimensional points, preform basic arithmetic on
        those points, sort the points within the cluster from least to greatest, preform comparisons on both the
        points and the clusters, find the distance between points, and stream both clusters and points in from a
        stream, and out to a stream.

            Created by Matthew Michaelis, based on the Programming Assignment 2 source files
        in C++ using CLion 1.2.4, cmake 3.3.2, GCC 4.9.3. Also tested on the csegrid using GCC 4.8.2.
